# Runtime Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** As of the time this document has changed, Distillery now supports `config.exs` natively. 
To use `config.exs` rather than the old `sys.config` file, simply set the
following in your `rel/config.exs`:

```elixir
release :myapp do
  set config_providers: [{Mix.Releases.Config.Providers.Elixir, ["var/config.exs"]}]
end
```

When using this config provider, you can configure your application the same way
you normally would when running under Mix. It works by compiling your
`config.exs` file, and it's imports, into a single `config.exs` file which is
then placed in the release. The editable version of this is placed in
`var/config.exs` for you by Distillery, which is why that path is given above in
the provider's argument list.

If you are using the `Elixir` config provider, then most of the following
content does not apply to you, with the exception of the parts on configuration
conventions, as that is still applicable to all forms of runtime configuration.

### Configuration Conventions

**NOTE:** It is no longer recommended to use the `{:system, "VAR"}` convention, as it has inconsistent
use in the community, and instead we'd rather push people towards an approach which works every time,
rather than only sometimes.

Instead the recommend approach to configuration is as follows:

- Provide default configuration in `config/config.exs`
- Provide configuration values known in advance for a given environment in `config/<env>.exs`
- For any runtime configuration, either set those values in the Application `start/2` callback, prior
to starting your supervisor tree, or in the `init/1` callbacks of individual supervisors/workers in your application.
You can use Elixir code to load configuration from wherever, and validate it closest to where it's used. It is recommended
that you create your own `Config` module which boxes up common validation/loading logic so that you can easily get config
values at runtime without cluttering up your `start/2` or `init/1` callbacks.

The above approach works for both release and deploy-source deployments, and so works the same everywhere. In addition,
it keeps configuration close to where it's cared about, and enables you to pick up configuration changes when you restart
parts of the application without needing to restart the whole release.

### Configuring Dependencies

If you have dependencies which require runtime configuration and you cannot use `config.exs` to do so, you should add them to `included_applications` and start them
as part of your supervisor tree, as shown below.

```elixir
defmodule MyApplication do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    import Supervisor.Spec

    # Do your configuration here
    Application.put_env(:some_dep, :some_key, some_val)

    children = [
      # You need to replace `:some_dep` here with the name of the module
      # containing `:some_dep`'s application module. For example, our application
      # is called `:myapp`, but our application module is `MyApplication`, so we would
      # use `MyApplication` in the supervisor specification here, not `:myapp`.
      # You can easily determine this by looking at the `mix.exs` of the dependency, or the
      # `.app` file in an Erlang application.
      supervisor(:some_dep, [:normal, []], function: :start),
      ...
    ]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

### Configuration Tools

It may be the case that you are providing release packages to end users, who will need to configure the
application. These end users may even be your own internal ops team. They may or may not be familiar with
Erlang terms, and thus `sys.config` is a very poor configuration experience. In these situations you may
want to consider an alternative configuration tool I wrote, called [conform](https://github.com/bitwalker/conform).
It was designed specifically for use with releases, and with ease of use for end-users as the ultimate goal.

As a developer, you define a schema which maps simple configuration settings contained in an init-style `.conf` file,
into the specific structures required for your application's configuration. To see an example of what these look
like, [take a look here](https://github.com/bitwalker/conform#conf-files-and-schema-files).

When you deploy your application, users simply modify the `.conf` file as needed, and run the release, `conform` handles
converting the configuration into runtime configuration for the release using the schema, and you can access that
configuration via `Application.get_env/2` as usual.

## vm.args

This file is how you configure the Erlang runtime for your release. By default, it sets up the VM in distributed mode
with the name set to `<release_name>@127.0.0.1`, and the cookie set to `<release_name>`. This is how we are able to
remote shell to the node once it's started.

For a complete list of flags you can use in `vm.args`, see [here](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html).

However, as is often the case, you may want to dynamically configure the name of the node (when clustering) and/or
the cookie (for security), as well as other settings based on values provided via environment variables. You can do
so by setting `REPLACE_OS_VARS=true` and then using `${VAR_NAME}` in the `vm.args` file.

If you are uncertain where the default `vm.args` is located, you may find it under `releases/<version>/vm.args`.

You may also provide your own config directory where your custom `vm.args`, `sys.config`, and potentially other
configuration files will be loaded from, by setting `RELEASE_CONFIG_DIR=path/to/files`. By default this will be set
to the root directory of the release, i.e. the folder to which you extracted the tarball. If `vm.args` or `sys.config`
cannot be found in `RELEASE_CONFIG_DIR`, it will fall back to using the ones under the `releases/<version>` directory.

## run\_erl

The `run_erl` command is responsible for running a release on Unix systems,
capturing STDERR and STDOUT so that all output can be logged as well as
allowing monitoring and remote debugging of a running release.

Several environment variables are useful in configuring `run_erl`, for
example to customize logging output.  To specify environment variables to
apply to `run_erl`, you can add a line like
`set run_erl_env: "RUN_ERL_LOG_MAXSIZE=10000000 RUN_ERL_LOG_GENERATIONS=10"`
in your release configuration.

This configuration can also be specified in the `RUN_ERL_ENV`
environment variable at the time of running `mix release`.

For a complete list of environment variables respected by `run_erl`, see
[here](http://erlang.org/doc/man/run_erl.html).
