### Description of issue

- What are the expected results?
- What version of Distillery?
- What OS, Erlang/Elixir versions are you seeing this issue on?
- If possible, also provide your `rel/config.exs`, as it is often
  my first troubleshooting question, and you'll save us both time :)
- Is there documentation that says one thing, but Distillery does
  another? If so, please link the doc here so it can be updated if
  it's a documentation issue, or so that the fix can be based around
  what's documented.
- If this is a runtime configuration issue, please also provide your config file 
  (with any sensitive information stripped of course). This is almost
  always necessary to understand why some configuration may not be working.

If you do not provide the above information and I need it to help troubleshoot, it may delay things significantly,
as I will have to ask you for all of these things anyway. Help me help you!
